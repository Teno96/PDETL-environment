[Here](virtual-machine-installation.md) you can find instructions to install and configure a Linux virtual machine base software package. 
If you want to speed up the process, install the virtual machine (first section of the instructions file) and later run the following shell scripts in a terminal:

[virtual-machine-installation-sudo.sh](virtual-machine-installation-sudo.sh): 
Requires `root` privileges, so run with:
```sh
sudo bash ./virtual-machine-installation-sudo.sh
```

[virtual-machine-installation.sh](virtual-machine-installation.sh): 
No `root` privileges requires, so just use:
```sh
bash ./virtual-machine-installation.sh
```
