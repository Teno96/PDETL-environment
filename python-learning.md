# Resources to learn Python/Jupyter

Here follows a list of (a few) available resources to learn Python. Try any of these sources, to edit Python code you can use a Jupyter notebook or Thonny.

## Books

All books listed here can be used as an introductory couse, they are open and have .pdf versions to download (among other formats).

* [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/)
  * Quite simple, quite applicable, with some nice introduction to object-oriented programming.
* [Think Python](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/)
  * This book has examples available in this GitHub [repository](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkPython2/tree/master/code) (actually the entire book is available as source code).
* [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/book)
  * This book is based on the first two with some additional introductory content to general informatics and also some additional material on web development and databases usage. :exclamation: The website of the book also have video classes that can be used as an introductory class.

## Online courses

The courses listed here can be taken as audit student on [Coursera](https://coursera.org),similar courses are available at [edX](https://www.edx.org/), just pick one!
Actually the links here are for Coursera Specializations, these specializations are series of courses in the same topick, usually growing in complexity. You can see individual courses list on each one and take the courses isolated.

* [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python#courses)
  * This specialization is related (practically the same) as the material available of the third book listed. Try the book website first.
* [Fundamentals of Computing](https://pt.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals)
  * This is a more complex and interesting specialization, its not entirely focused on Python, is more a software development and computer science fundamentals introduction. Very interesting and very practical (it uses Python 2, but that's by no means something that invalidates the course).

## YouTube

In all areas related with computer science, [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) has became a invaluable source of material. For every programming language feature or every library you want to use, check YouTube for videos about it. For Python particularly, all major conferences presentations are being fully uploaded to YouTube (such as [SciPy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He9MCbs1wgE&list=PLYx7XA2nY5GfdAFycPLBdUDOUtdQIVoMf), an international Python for science and engineering applications conference).

### Jupyter

Jupyter is a great environment to science and engineering, it combines text editor (with Markdown syntax, LaTeX equations, etc.), Python code, plotting, HTML, etc. 

To launch Jupyter Notebook on your virtual machine open a terminal and enter the commands:

```sh
source activate notebook
jupyter notebook
```

Firefox browser will open with the main Jupyter page.

Here follows some links to the basics of Jupyter notebooks.
